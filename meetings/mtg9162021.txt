Talked about an initial list of Embedded Gaps in RiscV Architecture

Secure boot
	How is root of trust handled -  key0 support?
	Current mechanism of SBI being used as a called back from Linux is a huge blocker (IMO) for this.  
	Any callback to a previous binary w/o someway to validate that binary has not been compromised 
	is a hard sell for those who require secure boot.  
TEE – Trusted Execution Environment (ARM calls this Trust Zone) Place to hide your secret sauce/keys/etc.. 

Was discussed as to what Platform/Profile Secure Boot/TEE falls under?  

Industry Requirements – Automotive/Military/etc.

Discussed having these type of requirements be in addition to the current embedded requirements. 
For example: In order to meet automotive, you need to have X + the automotive requirements implemented.
Same for Military.
Do we need to do anything and/or does RISC-V current requirements clash with any industry requirements? 

Low power requirements
Where does this fall in terms of RISC-V architecture?  Is this more of a product design feature?



Current State of Embedded Design in RISC-V?
Recommend to get with Stephano about a survey of what is current state of embedded for RISC-V.

Industry Trade Shows
How best to present RISC-V?

Thea : We have a presence at a emebedded trade show next year.  She will send out info to our mailing list.  
Deadline for submitting proposals is soon.

Thea brought up that YOCTO is very excited about RISC-V
YOCTO is basing there HowTo on RISC-V. 
Hardware  = SiFive HW
Suggest that YOCTO also use QEMU RiscV for this.

Suggested Thea reach out to buildroot community.
