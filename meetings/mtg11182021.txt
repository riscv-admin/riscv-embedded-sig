Meeting 11/18/2021



Vedyvas gave a presentation about some of the areas his company is workign on.

The slides for this are in the github repo at: https://github.com/riscv-admin/riscv-embedded-sig

It was a very imformative presentation and I think this will give us a good starting point for addressing 
gaps within the RiscV Ecosystem in terms of Embedded Systems.

Starting in Jan (I am canceling the Dec meeting due to Holidays, etc..) I would like to use Vedyvas presentation as a starting point to 
put together a list of gaps we see in the RiscV Ecosystem and rank them both in terms of priority as well as ease of filling them. 
(There maybe some low hanging fruit that we can easily address.)
